      "Python Quick Tip: The Difference Between “==” and “is” (Equality vs Identity) In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be learning the difference between using “==” and the “is” keyword when doing comparisons. The difference between these is that “==” checks to see if values are equal, and the “is” keyword checks their identity, which means it’s going to check if the values are identical in terms of being the same object in memory. We’ll learn more in the video. Let’s get started… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO_dS3rXDIs \n",
